        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>My name is Bijay Bohora, and I hail from the lively city of Kathmandu, where I was born on December 26, 2004. I completed my high school education at Uniglobe College, where I honed my academic skills and laid the foundation for my future endeavors. Currently, I am immersed in the world of computer programming at Lambton College, delving into the intricacies of coding and software development.

            In parallel with my academic pursuits, I am gaining practical experience in the hospitality industry. I am currently employed as a coat check attendant at the esteemed Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto. This role has not only allowed me to interact with a diverse clientele but also to develop essential customer service and organizational skills.
            
            My journey reflects my passion for both technology and hospitality. I am deeply committed to expanding my knowledge and expertise in computer programming while also excelling in my professional responsibilities. This blend of academic rigor and practical experience drives me to achieve excellence in all aspects of my life.</p>
